# Unity Fish Flocking
An implementation of the flocking algorithm in Unity 3D.

**Important** This version of FishFlocker is
  * clean coded
  * Performance-optimized
  * possibility for a target (and not only zero-target)
  * fish spawn within a container on the position of the container
  * possibility for multiple container and targets
  * more setup directly in inspector
  * more Bugfree than original
  * and many more..

The "Colorful Sea-Fish" pack is not included in this repository as it is not free. If you'd like to use this, go and buy that pack!

# FishFlocker
An implementation of the flocking algorithm in Unity.

**Important** This version of Streamweaver/FishFlocker is
  * more Bugfree
  * cleaner coded
  * Performance-optimized
  * possibility for a target (and not only zero-target)
  * fish spawn within a container on the position of the container
  * possibility for multiple container and targets
  * and many more..

The Colorful Sea-Fish pack is **not** included in this repository as it is not free.  If you'd like to use this, buy that pack or just replace the game objects with any you would like to use instead, even primative shapes work fine (although they will have no animation obviously).
